## Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Steps to build MLmodel

- Step 1: Importing and Understanding Data
- Step 2: Visualising the Data
- Step 3: Data Preparation
- Step 4: Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Step 5: Building a linear model
- Step 6: Residual Analysis of the train data
- Step 7: Making Predictions Using the Final Model
- Step 8: R-square for test data
- Step 9: Model Evaluation
- Step 10: Final Interpretation

## Conclusions

As we want answers of following questions, Let's see what is conclusin from model

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
-   As we can see that temperature has highest coefficiant i.e 0.4205. So increse in temperature is good for business
-   Also as the year 2018 businees is less due to covid,but in 2019 it is started recovering
-   Also Light snow have highest negative coeefiient of -0.2424.so in snow peoples are staying at home because of that its affect on demand of baikes.
-   Also humidity, cloudy weather, wind speed has negative effet on bsiness
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
-   In this ML Model the percent difference between train data and test data is 2.42%. Therefore model is good fitted and it is giving very good describetion of varibles on bike demands
